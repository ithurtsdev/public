# Getting started with It Hurts
**It Hurts** is a technical debt manager. It lives right in your IDE so you can share your concerns about the code with your teammates without leaving it. It also adds a great visibility of existing problems when you are working with the code.

Moreover, It Hurts integrates with your code repositories, keeping track of repositories events and automatically updates the debt records, trying to keep everything up-to-date.

This article describes how to start to work with It Hurts in a few steps.

## Connect It Hurts to your codebase
Sign in to It Hurts with one of supported source code hosting services (currently, only Bitbucket is supported), then click "Create workspace" on the dashboard right-top menu. You will be redirected to It Hurts for Bitbucket app authorization dialog. Choose workspace/organisation you want It Hurts connected to. As soon as you grant It Hurts access to your repositories, your It Hurts workspace is created.

> **Note:** Unfortunately, for now It Hurts for Bitbucket is not listed in Atlassian Marketplace, that's why you will need to enable development mode for your Butbucket Cloud workspace to connect It Hurts to it.
